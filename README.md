## AI code review

This repository uses [rs-guard](https://github.com/nebulaideas/rs-guard) for automated code review, both as a pre-commit hook and as a GitHub Actions workflow on pull requests.

### Pre-commit hook

The hook is in `.githooks/pre-commit`. Activate it for this clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Or use the helper script:

```sh
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Requirements:

- `rs-guard` installed (`cargo install rs-guard`)
- An API key exported (e.g. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) or in `~/.config/rs-guard/env`

Bypass the hook when needed:

```sh
git commit --no-verify
```

### CI / GitHub Actions

The workflow `.github/workflows/rs-guard-review.yml` runs on every non-draft pull request. It requires a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` repository secret.

## Configuration

- `AGENTS.md` — project rules and domain glossary; auto-loaded by rs-guard as supplemental context.
- `.github/review-prompt.md` — the review prompt used by both local and CI runs.
- `.reviewer.toml` — rs-guard configuration (provider, model, timeout).
- `.rs-guardignore` — paths excluded from review diffs.
